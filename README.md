#Async mapping with AutoMapper
This shows you how to use the https://github.com/ArcadyIT/AutoMapper in an angularJs enviroment when you need async mapping.
You have this for example:

```

interface ILinkDto {
	rel: string;
	href: string;
}

interface IPersonDto {
	name: string;
	links: ILinkDto[];
}

interface IPerson extends IPersonDto {
	address: IAddress;
}

var objA: IPersonDto = { 
	name: 'Gerry Rafferty',
	links: [ { rel: 'address', href: '/api/address/1'}] 
}

```

If you would like to map objA on to IPersonDto you will find there is a little challenge because you need to wait for the async result 
from the restfull endpoint /api/address/1 to map the address. 

The trick is to use convertToType and provide a then function in this class for the mapping.

```

		MapBase.prototype = this.hateoasService;
		automapper.createMap('IPersonDto', 'IHateoasService<IPerson>')
			.convertToType(MapBase);

		var personHateoasService: IHateoasService<IPerson> = automapper.map('IPersonDto', 'IHateoasService<IPerson>', personDto);
	    personHateoasService.then((person: IPerson) => {
			this.currentPerson = person;
		});

```

#Install and try this thing
npm install
bower install
tsd install
tsd link
gulp
gulp

Yes the first time gulp seems to fail. Op index.html in the browser to see this thing work.
